## Procedures

### Direct Instruction
1. Should a complex website (`smh.com.au`); generate conversation about that is on the page (prompt to headings, paragraphs, images, multimedia.)
1. Show the source of the website in the browser.
1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. It is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
1. Consists of a series of elements, which enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, and can make font bigger or smaller, and so on.
1. Demo the text `The grumpy cat is small` without enclosed in a tag, then enclosed in each of `<span>, <div>, <small>, <strong>, <p>, <h1>`
1. Describe opening tags, closing tags, self-closing tags.
1. Describe nested elements (e.g. `<div><h1></h1><p></p><div>`)
### Guided Practice
1. If you were designing a mark up language, what tags would you create? How would you structure the page? What about appearance? Behaviour?
